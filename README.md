# Calculadora Android - ReactNative

That's my first project using RN, in it I built a very simple Android Calculator, with the following operations: addition, subtraction, division and multiplication




## Documentação

In this project i've used the following technologies:

- ReactJS: 17.0.2,
- React-Native: 0.68.0,

The organization is very simple, because, inside src, there are only 2 folders and 2 files.

In the first folder ('Button'), it has all the Button's components, that represents all numbers and operations.

The second folder ('Visor'), have just the display, where it shows the numbers.

The las two files, its the app.js and style.js.





## Instalação

Running the project is also very simple, but it needs all the programs necessary to run a ReactNative application.

You can see how to install them, here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

After all installation, all you have to do is, clone the repository on your desktop:

```git clone https://github.com/PauloMendees/CalculadoraRN```

After this, run in the project folder:

```npm install```

And finally, run:

```npx react-native run-android```
